Aggregate Function Based On
Aggregate Function field is required to create a dashboard chart
Aggregate group of **Items** into another **Item**. This is useful if you are bundling a certain **Items** into a package and you maintain stock of the packed **Items** and not the aggregate **Item**. ||||||The package **Item** will have "Is Stock Item" as "No" and "Is Sales Item" as "Yes".||||||For Example: If you are selling Laptops and Backpacks separately and have a special price if the customer buys both, then the Laptop + Backpack will be a new Product Bundle Item.||||||Note: BOM = Bill of Materials
